# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  

## Objective  
Clean and prepare the **Mall Customers Dataset** by handling duplicates, standardizing values, and making columns consistent.  

## Steps Performed  
1. Checked dataset for missing values (none found).  
2. Removed duplicate records based on `customer_id`.  
3. Standardized categorical values in `gender` column (male/female).  
4. Renamed column headers into lowercase with underscores.  
5. Ensured correct data types (age, income, spending_score as integers/numerical).  
6. Saved the final cleaned dataset as `Mall_Customers_Cleaned.xlsx`.  

## Deliverables  
- Raw dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`)  
- Cleaned dataset (`Mall_Customers_Cleaned.xlsx`)  
- This README file  

## Tools Used
